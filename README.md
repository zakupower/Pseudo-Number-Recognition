# Pseudo-Number-Recognition

It's pseudo because it's is not really learning or recognizing.
You could say this was my bruto force attempt at the problem single digit recognition.
I use a sample gallery of all the digits 0-9 and divide the image into  two areas one that is white
and one that is not white. I use that as a pattern and match the differences in the patterns.
